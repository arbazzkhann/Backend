# What is Node.js :
1. **JavaScript Runtime**: Node.js is an **open-source**, **cross-platform runtime environment** for executing Javascript code outside of a browser.

2. Node.js is a JavaScript in a different environment means Running JS on the server or any computer.

3. Built on **Chrome's V8 Engine**: It runs on the V8 engine, which compiles JavaScript directly to native machine code, enhancing performance.

4. V8 is written in C++ for speed.

5. **V8 engine** + **Backend Features** = **Node.js**

## Node.js Pros:
1. **Design**: Features an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model for efficiency.

2. **Full-stack**: Allows using JavaScript on both **Server** and **Client** sides.

3. **Scalability**: **Ideal for scalable network applications** due to **its architecture**.

4.  **Versatility**: Suitable for **web**, **real-time chat** and **REST API Servers**.


## Node.js Features:
1. **Non-blocking I/O**: Designed to **perform non-blocking operations by default**, making it suitable for I/O-heavy operations.

2. **Network Support**: **Supports TCP/UDP sockets**, which are crucial for building lower-level network applications that browsers can't handle.

3. **File System Access**: **Provides APIs** to **read** and **write** **files directly**, which is not possible in browser environments for security reasons.

4. **Server-side capabilities**: Node.js **enables JavaScript to run on the server**, **handling HTTP requests**, **file operations**, and **other server-side functionalities**.

5. **Modules**: Organize code into reusable modules using **require()**.
