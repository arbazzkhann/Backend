# Node.js Event Loop (Simplified)

This is how the Node.js Event Loop works based on the diagram:

1. **Requests Arrive**  
   Incoming requests are received by the Node.js server.

2. **Event Queue**  
   Requests are placed into the **Event Queue**.

3. **Event Loop**  
   The Event Loop constantly checks the Event Queue and processes each task one by one.

4. **Thread Pool (libuv)**  
   Time-consuming tasks (like file operations, DB queries, etc.) are passed to a Thread Pool.

5. **External Operations**  
   The Thread Pool handles communication with:
   - **Databases**
   - **File Systems**
   - **Networks**
   - **Others**

6. **Operation Completed**  
   Once the task is completed, the result is passed back to the Event Loop.

7. **Send Response**  
   The Event Loop sends the final response to the client.

> 🔁 This loop continues, allowing Node.js to handle multiple operations asynchronously and efficiently.
